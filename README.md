# Advanced Java Assignments - OCCC

## About This Repository
This repository contains a collection of assignments I completed while taking the **Advanced Java** course at OCCC. The projects span a variety of topics listed below.

## Topics Covered
- **Functional Programming**: Introduction to functional concepts in Java.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Exploring inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **GUI Programming**: Using Swing to create graphical user interfaces, with practical applications in:
  - **Unit Five**: Introduction to Swing basics.
  - **Unit Six**: Intermediate GUI components and layouts.
  - **Unit Eight**: Advanced GUI concepts.

## Final Project: Person Management Application
The course culminated in a final project that builds upon concepts introduced earlier in the semester. The project:
- Implements the **Person** class and its subtypes.
- Integrates features developed incrementally from **Unit Four** onward.
- Results in a fully functional GUI application that allows users to maintain a file of Persons.

### Features of the Final Project
- **Add, Edit, and Delete Persons**: Supports different types of persons, including `RegisteredPerson` and `OCCCPerson`.
- **File Handling**: Load and save data to persist changes.
- **Intuitive GUI**: A user-friendly interface developed using Swing.
